# Restaurant Page (The Odin Project) 🍝

Hi! This is my project for the **DOM Manipulation** module. The challenge here was to build a restaurant website where the entire content is generated by JavaScript—no HTML allowed in the body (except for a container div)!

I also learned how to use **Webpack** to bundle my code and organize the Home, Menu, and Contact pages into separate modules.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Dynamic Rendering:** JavaScript creates all the HTML elements when the page loads.
- **Tabbed Browsing:** You can switch between tabs to see the Menu or Contact info without the page reloading.
- **Webpack:** Bundles all the modules and assets into the `dist` folder.
